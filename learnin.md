# New Knowledge

## Pointers
1. Steal Dr. Kelley's example code
1. Looking at documentation is a good thing - using just a couple keywords usually yields results.
1. Github has a whole markdown language
1. Be careful when naming variables, don't use an already used keyword or function

## Open Questions

1. Command line: how do you navigate?? Look at `cd` and `dir`
1. When to use brackets, partheneses? MATLAB/python puzzle
3. Desktop github app? What the...?
1. What is Dr. Kelley's PhD on  - The dynamics and thermodynamics of soft-wall AdS/QCD - related to RHIC.
5. Indexing arrays - `[r,c]`, how does it work? We will talk about this on 1.16.
1. Is there a fair 7-sided di?
1. What data sets should we use with MATLAB for efficiency ?
1. Syntax can be tricky
1. How to change data type? Look for notebook about this
1.

## MATLAB 
1. Simulink has tutorials, as well as others on MathWorks
1. Using `=` (assignment) vs `==` (comparsion)
1. Must Run if you change variables to new results
1. `sprintf`, `disp`, `display` to print results
1. Pay attention to matlab's warnings
1. Plotting functions - `hold on` `hold off`
1. Plotting where to put `hold off` relative to legend?
1. `T =input(<prompt>)` is the code to capture user input
1. `disp` -> prints to command line
1. Toolboxes can be installed for free from toolbar
1. Documentation is updated on mathworks website, but there is built in doc as well
1. Loading files `load('smallperiodtable')` will always load the .mat file (if no extension)
1. Loading files with `load('CompProbSol/problem4/smallperiodtable')`
1. `h=plot(x,y)` allows you to hold the axes in `h`
1. 'figure()' creates a figure window
1. 'nestedsortstruct()' is a mathwork central function
1. Mathworks File exchange is a good reference
1. use `isnan` to find not-a-number missing data
## Python
1. Exponent in python is not `^` but `**`
1. Indexing in python is very different from MATLAB, due to indexing starting at 0.

## General
1. Know your extensions (saving file with wrong, it's trouble).
1. Graphics have thousands of options
