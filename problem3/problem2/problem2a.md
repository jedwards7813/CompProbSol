Problem \#2a *Go Git 'em!* 
=======================

**NAME**:

Outcomes 
--------

-   Create repositories on GitHub

-   Push updates up to the Github site

Problem 
-------

From now on, we need to share files in a way that allows the most
up-to-date versions are accessible to all concerned parties. I have gone
through *some* the highlights and features of *GitHub*, and I hope that you
see the benefit of such a system. All assignments will be "turned in"
using this system. (Really, all you have to do is keep your code files
in the folders that correspond to your repository on *GitHub*). Let's
get it set up. **There are many ways to accomplish the following tasks;
find the easiest way for you**

1.  `clone` the repository `CompProbSol` and store in on your local
    drive. This repo will contain homework assignments and example code
    and will be updated before every class period.

2.  Create a repository in the `Phys1211` organization at
    <https://github.com/Phys1211>. Name it:
    `[firstname initial][lastname]` with no spaces.

3.  `Push` all the code files up to the repository and check that they
    are present on GitHub.

4.  Now let's update the script file `satellites.m`:

    1.  Modify the file so that the command line takes the input `T` the period of the satellite. It might be a good idea to use a meaningful prompt that includes what units the input should
        be reported in.

    2.  Modify the program so that it also calculates and prints the
        velocity $v$ of the satellite at a particular $h$.

    3.  Round off the orbital altitude and velocity before printing
        them.

    4. What happens when you set `T = [90 100 110 120 130]`?

    5.  Time permitting, be imaginative and add any other flourishs to the program.

6.  Finally, push these modified files up to you GitHub repository and
    check at `github.com/Phys1211` that you were successful
