# Problem 6 "Conjunction Junction what's your Function in Python"
## Outcomes
- Correct code in python
- Explore differences in syntax 

## Problem 

Open the Python program called `satellite.py` located in the `problem6` folder on `CompProbSol`. The syntax of this program is more MATLAB than Python. If you run this file, it will give you an error. Use what you learned today to fix the mistakes so that the program prints the satellite's orbital altitude and speed values and their plots. Add axes labels to both plots.
