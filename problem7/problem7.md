# Problem 7 "Cracking the code on data types"
## Outcomes
- Familiarize yourself with the data types in Python
- Manipulate several data structures in Python
- Reason through a logical puzzle

## Problem 

Open the Python program called `encoded.py` located in the `problem7` folder on `CompProbSol`. In this file you will find the text of the Gettysburg Address and a dictionary named `codex`. Use the dictionary to encode the Gettysburg Address text, that is turn the string `gettysburg` into a list or array of numbers according to the correspondence in `codex`. In addition, write code that turns this list of numbers back into the Gettysburg Address. Include both operations as separate function within the file `encoded.py` and name them `encode` and `decode`, respectively. Encode should take a string and return a list of numbers, and decode should take a list of numbers and return the long string as it was before, .

Once you have finish, use your functions to decode the list of numbers in `hint.py`. This contains a hint about you midterm exam. WARNING: I added another layer of complication to my `hint`, but you should be able to understand what I did if you take a close look at the numbers in `hint` and if I tell you there is one `-` in the statement.
