
# Phys 1211: Final Project
## Due April 2019

The Final Project is the "capstone" of Physics 1211. It comprises 20% of the course grade. It will consist of two parts

-   Paper/Programs ($\sim$15%) - due April 4, 2019 by end of the day

-   Presentation ($\sim$5%) - April 11 - April 18

Defining the Project 
====================

The topic of the Final Project is extremely flexible. Students are to
choose a well-scoped and well-defined research question (does not need
to be original) from any field of physics. Once a topic is chosen,
students should read the appropriate background material (research
papers, textbooks, etc.) to gain an understanding of the main and
related topics. Students should then determine what numerical techniques
could be employed to illustrate, demostrate, or answer the research
question.

*If you are currently engrossed in a research project, please consider
using this project to further that research.* Don't think too big;
projects always take much longer and require much more time than you
think. *At least six* unique programming techniques need to be included
in the Final Project.

Paper 
-----

The scientific paper portion of the project will consist of a 3- to
5-page report. You *could* write this in the old, boring way, but **I
strongly suggest that you complete this "paper" using Jupyter Notebooks
or Live Scripts in MATLAB (even Mathematica has live script behavior)**.
You could embed your code directly in your writing, learn all about
markdown languages, and have all the graphics automatically generate
themselves. In any case this report should include:

-   an introduction of the topic including pertinent background
    information.

-   an explanation of why this is an interesting research question,
    placing it in the context of the larger field of physics.

-   an explanation of your numerical analysis/computational
    demostration. **Of course, this would be easy in a Jupyter Notebook
    or MATLAB live script**

-   plots, graphics, tables, or other appropriate visual representations
    of the data and results.**Of course, these would be easy to include
    and format in a Jupyter Notebook or MATLAB live script.**

-   a conclusion summarizing your topic and suggesting further research
    possibilities.

-   a list of sources (7 minimum).

Presentation 
------------

The presentation portion of the Final project is a chance to present
your research results to a community of your peers. The presentation
should include:

-   an introduction to the topic, placing your topic in the context of
    the field of physics.

-   an explanation of the numerical analysis.

-   graphics to illustrate your results.

The exact schedule of presentations will be determined by April 2. The
length of the presentation may vary, but plan to give a 10-minute
presentation (much shorter time than you would think).

Dates to keep in mind\... 
-------------------------

DO NOT put this off until April! Getting started is the hardest part, so
get started TODAY!!! There are some intermediate *due dates*:

-   Feb 21, 5 p.m. - Reseach Question/Topic (send email to
    `th.kelley@northeastern.edu`)

-   March 12, 5 p.m. -Project summary (uploaded to github folder)

-   March 28, 5 p.m. - First Draft of your paper (uploaded to github
    folder)

-   April 9, 5 p.m. - Presentation slides/outline (uploaded to github
    folder)
