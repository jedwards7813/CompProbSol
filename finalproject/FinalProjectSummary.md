# Final Project Summary
### Due March 12 (Yes, very soon after spring break)
### Push up to your github repository by midnight

In preparation for the final project, you will submit a brief summary outlining more details about your plans. In this summary, you will specify:
- the topic
- the scope (what are you going to do with this topic)
- the type of program you will write
- the objectives your project will achieve

This is an opportunity for *you* to specify the scope of your project, and what justifies "success". Be ambitious, but realistic - I will tell you if you set the bar too low. 

I want this project to be a chance for you to learn, so spend some time to think about the journey through the project - the steps it will take to complete it before ultimately setting a goal.
